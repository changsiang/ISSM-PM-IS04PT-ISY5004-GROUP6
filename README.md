## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Vision loss poses a significant health risk, particularly in aging populations. It is closely linked to reduced quality of life, increased dependence, and worsened health outcomes. Timely detection and treatment can help delay the progression of vision loss. However, regular eye checks often face accessibility challenges due to the scarcity of trained specialists. To address this issue, our project aims to enhance the accessibility of routine eye health assessments by developing a vision intelligent system to enable automating visual acuity checks. By leveraging technology, we aspire to improve the availability and convenience of such assessments, ultimately promoting proactive eye care.
